= fieldmod

Utility to modify the `modifiers` field on `Field` for several Java versions.

Java 12 removed the ability to use the good ol' `Field#getDeclaredField` on
`modifiers`, requiring code special to support the version. This abstracts that
and the old variant away into the same interface.

== Interface

The utility is accessed through a non-instantiable class called `FieldMod`.

The utility class has four static methods:

  - `#setup()` - Sets up the required fields for the Java version this variant
represents. This only performs setup upon the first call; all subsequent calls
are no-ops.
  - `#setModifiers(Field, int)` - Sets the modifiers of a field using the
current Java version's preferred approach. The exceptions are generally fine to
ignore as they're unlikely to be thrown. If wanted to be checked, one can adapt
behaviour by first calling `#setup`. The exceptions thrown by this method are
simply from that very method and may thus be called ahead of this as a single
call to `#setup` makes all subsequent ones no-ops.
  - `#setModifiersNoThrow(Field, int)` - Sets the modifiers of a field using
the current Java version's preferred approach. This is merely a no exceptions
thrown version of `#setModifiers`. This does not print the stack trace upon
catching exceptions, but rather returns a boolean of whether it was successful.
  - `#setModifiersSneaky(Field, int)` - Sets the modifiers of a field using the
current Java version's preferred approach. This is merely a sneaky throws
version of `#setModifiers`.

== Usage

How to include the utility in projects.

Maven users will have to figure out how to do it themselves.

=== Gradle (Groovy)

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven {
    name = 'proxi-nexus'
    url = 'https://nexus.proximyst.com/repository/maven-public/'
  }
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.proximyst.fieldmod:fieldmod:0.2.1'
}
----

=== Gradle (Kotlin)

[source,kotlin]
----
repositories {
  maven {
    name = "proxi-nexus"
    url = uri("https://nexus.proximyst.com/repository/maven-public/")
  }
}

dependencies {
  implementation("com.proximyst.fieldmod:fieldmod:0.2.1")
}
